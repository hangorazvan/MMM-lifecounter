As a number, 1 billion is an almost unimaginable. Here’s a way to help you imagine it. Use 1 billion—with its nine zeros—to measure your time. Look forward or back to your 1-billionth-second birthday (aprox. 31 years, 8 months, 9 days) or 2-billionth-second birthday (aprox. 63 years, 4 months, 18 days) maybe even 3-billionth-second birthday (aprox. 95 years, 27 days). Mark it. Celebrate it. Then keep counting. Measure 1 billion with the seconds of your life.
